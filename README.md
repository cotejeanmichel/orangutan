# Orangutan Theme

A medium contrast monochrome theme for folks who don't particularily like working in a high contrast rainbow environment all day and who could manage to write code with a pen on paper if needed.

- White, grays and amber to make a minimum of stuff pop out.
- Some use of text decoration to add a little texture.
- Avoided blue tints.
- Supports mostly `Javascript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JSON`.
